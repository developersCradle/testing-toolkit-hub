>One afternoon, during a release crunch, the problem escalated. A critical module needed **unit test** coverage before merge approval—but we had only 15 minutes to add the tests so the pipeline could pass and the deployment window wouldn’t be missed.

All course material from *WireMock for Java Developers* by **Pragmatic Code School**.

> We were integrating with a third-party payment gateway that had unpredictable response times and occasional schema changes. Our QA environment depended on that external API being up and stable — which it rarely was. Tests would pass one day and fail the next, and debugging became a guessing game. To make things worse, the provider rate-limited us, so reproducing issues locally was nearly impossible.
>
>A recent deep dive I had taken into WireMock turned out to be a game changer. Instead of relying on the unstable external service, I stood up a local mock server that replicated the exact API behavior — including edge cases, timeouts, and error responses.<br><br>
